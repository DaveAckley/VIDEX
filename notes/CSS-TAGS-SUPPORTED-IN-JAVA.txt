The following describes the CSS properties that are suppored by the rendering engine:

    font-family
    font-style
    font-size (supports relative units)
    font-weight
    font
    color
    background-color (with the exception of transparent)
    background-image
    background-repeat
    background-position
    background
    background-repeat
    text-decoration (with the exception of blink and overline)
    vertical-align (only sup and super)
    text-align (justify is treated as center)
    margin-top
    margin-right
    margin-bottom
    margin-left
    margin
    padding-top
    padding-right
    padding-bottom
    padding-left
    border-style (only supports inset, outset and none)
    list-style-type
    list-style-position 

The following are modeled, but currently not rendered.

    font-variant
    background-attachment (background always treated as scroll)
    word-spacing
    letter-spacing
    text-indent
    text-transform
    line-height
    border-top-width (this is used to indicate if a border should be used)
    border-right-width
    border-bottom-width
    border-left-width
    border-width
    border-top
    border-right
    border-bottom
    border-left
    border
    width
    height
    float
    clear
    display
    white-space
    list-style 

Note: for the time being we do not fully support relative units, unless noted, so that p { margin-top: 10% } will be treated as if no margin-top was specified.
